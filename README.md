# Installation
> The installation guide needs more refinement, so there might be additional steps necessary or you might have to do your own research

> This modpack is distributed using the packwiz format, so you should be able to install this modpack with PrismLauncher, ATLauncher, MultiMC, etc.
> However the official method is through modrinth.

Follow [Pack Installation using packwiz-installer](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/).
Although the guide says it can be used with MultiMC/ATLauncher, Modrinth works too, replace $JAVA_INST with java
